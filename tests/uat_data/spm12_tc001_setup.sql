-- SPM-12-TC-001: Status badge follows the event from Draft to Confirmed
-- Acceptance criterion: AC 1
-- Login: daryl@gmail.com, jasmine@gmail.com, joyce@gmail.com, sally@gmail.com, tom@gmail.com - password is in the test case's Test Data / Test accounts
-- Inputs entered during the test (not inserted): see Test Data
-- Source: refined Preconditions of docs/Project Planning_refined_v2.xlsx
-- Records restored: none (the tester creates the records)
-- Must-not-exist conditions enforced: event "UAT Lifecycle Event" created by jasmine in an earlier run
-- Defaults added: organiser Jasmine and coordinator Joyce unless the case names others; event times, attendance (100), purpose and descriptions not stated in the case; workflow dates 18 Sep - 6 Oct 2026; test venues UAT Events Hall, UAT Hall, Main Hall, Room 2, UAT Seminar Hall, UAT Turnaround Hall; catalogue items Projector and Wireless microphone are the real ones (never changed)
-- Shared records: cases of a story use the same test events (UAT Expo, UAT Gala, UAT Hall...): test one story at a time.
-- Safe to re-run: changes this case's test records only; stops without changes if real data would be affected.
-- Run with: pnpm uat:setup spm12_tc001   (from the repo root)
