-- Acceptance criterion: AC3
-- Run with: pnpm uat:setup spm16_tc003   (from the repo root; see tests/uat_data/README.md)
-- Login: Venue Staff (daryl@gmail.com) - shared UAT password (kept with the team)
-- Inputs entered during the test (not inserted): none
-- Source: Venue Staff user is signed in.
-- Records restored: profiles daryl, jasmine, joyce; event "Orientation Week 2026" (id 00000000-0000-0000-0016-000000000201) whose page the tester tries to open
-- Must-not-exist conditions enforced: none
-- Defaults added: Event "Orientation Week 2026": organiser jasmine, coordinator joyce, Planning, 9 Dec 2026 09:00-12:00, 120 pax
-- Safe to re-run: changes this case's test records only; stops without changes if real data would be affected.
