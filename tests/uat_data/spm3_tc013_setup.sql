-- SPM-3-TC-013: Proposed end date/time exactly 1 minute after start date/time
-- Acceptance criterion: AC 2
-- Login: Event Organiser (jasmine@gmail.com) - password is in the test case's Test Data / Test accounts
-- Inputs entered during the test (not inserted): see Test Data
-- Source: refined Preconditions of docs/Project UAT kk_sher_refined.xlsx
-- Records restored: none (only the test accounts' profiles)
-- Must-not-exist conditions enforced: none
-- Defaults added: organiser Jasmine and coordinator Joyce unless the case names others; purpose, descriptions, attendance (100) and times not stated in the case; workflow dates 18 Sep - 9 Oct 2026; events that have already ended are dated 15 Oct 2026; test venues open all day unless stated
-- Shared records: cases of a story share its test events and venues: test one story at a time.
-- Safe to re-run: changes this case's test records only; stops without changes if real data would be affected.
-- Run with: pnpm uat:setup spm3_tc013   (from the repo root)
